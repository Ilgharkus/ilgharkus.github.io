## This is Ilghar_kus' personal site.
And embarrassingly a scruffy hacker like me still doesn't have a personal site.
But I will get one as soon as I have money to rent a usable Cloud server and time to write a blog engine.

## And about me
My universal ID is Ilghar_kus, also Ilgharkus on some underline_nonsupport sites like this one.
I'm a undergraduate student at Fudan University, China.
I'm interested in Cybersecurity, Free Software, Compute Theoryï¼ŒMath and some vintage computer things.
I use Arch Linux as well as FreeBSD as my main workstation system, and GNU Emacs as my main code editor, writing software and GTD software.
I use a Dell Inspiron 7590 as my workstation, GNOME 3 as my windows manager (planning to change to i3 as soon as I've read the entire documents and hack together a usable configuration.
I write in Mandarin and English, it depends.
My personal email address is ilghar_kus /at/ protonmail.com. You are welcome to send me a email which would be encrypted with PGP.
My PGP fingerprint is 1A64866B328C6A9092F02DD11C360F7878D2377B , you could search my public key on GnuPG key server.

And that's I've thought about. Probably will add some when it comes to my mind.
